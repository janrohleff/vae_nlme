The entire code was written by Jan Rohleff.

## Overview

The simulations reproduce the results presented in Case Study 1. Due to privacy restrictions, we are not permitted to share the real data from Case Study 2. Instead, we provide simulated data that illustrates the behavior of the VAE in this second case.

### Key Features

- Implementation of a Variational Autoencoder applied to nonlinear mixed-effects modeling
- Simultaneous parameter estimation and covariate selection
- One RUN is all you need
-  Requires the following Python packages: `torch`, `numpy`, `cvxpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy`
